About: Hospital readmission is a high-priority health care quality measure and target for cost reduction. Here we are trying to find the readmission rate of diabetic patients that significantly contribute a large portion in the cost and burden to the hospitals.
Predicting the possibility of readmission so that hospitals can be ready with the resources and also find the possible ways to reduce the reduces the rate of readmission.

Tools Used: Python, SQL, Excel & ML.

ML model used: Light GBM, Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest & others

Conclusion: In our best performing model (Light GBM Classifier)
We have got Precision of 58%, which indicates that out of total predicted positive 58% are true.
Positive Recall of 63%, which indicates that out of total actual positives ,. 63% are predicted are true positive 
F1_score, which is harmonic mean of precision and recall is  around 42%.
